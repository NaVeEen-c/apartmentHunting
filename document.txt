To find the nearest block ,we have to give the reward for each block, which is nearer to the list of requirements that you have declared in the list
more reward means more nearest to the required buildings.
First accesss the each block from the array of objects.One object contains all the information about one block
1.first created a empty object that stores the reward for each block
2.assign a temp variable with the reward 0 
3.set the rewards of all blocks to zero
4.access the one object or block details from the array of objects using for loop 
5.access all the requirements from the list one by one
6.then check if the required building is nearer to the block or not .if yes then increase reward of that specific block
7.compare reward with the tempvaraible to get heighest reward of a blocks
8.if the tempvariable less than reward then update temp variable with heighest reward 
9.go to the step 4 and do the same process for all the objects in the arry of objects 
10.after getting heighest reward,check all the blocks which contains the heighest reward
11.then return the block which is nearer to all the required buildings that declared in list of requirements
12.what if all the blocks doesnot contain the buildings that specified in list of requirements .then check all other buildings nearer to the block and give the rewards 
13.return the heighest reward block
